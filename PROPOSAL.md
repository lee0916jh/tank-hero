###Tank Hero

Tank Hero will be a 2D shooting game.
The player will control a tank and will be given 3 lives. The player will take out enemies that try to destroy the tank.
The game will be more challenging as the survival time increases.
If 3 enemies get to the tank, the player dies.
The goal of the game is to kill as many enemies possible and survive.

####Key commands
W: Move up\
A: Move left\
D: Move right\
S: Move down\
mouse drag: aim will follow mouse position\
mouse click: shoot bullet\
space bar: bomb (Kills all enemies immediately)

####Motivation
I wanted to create this game because this game will be a good toy project to make 
to practice how to deal with collision, changing movements, handling runtime user input, and 2D graphics rendering.

####Timeline
Week 1: Add 2d model of tank and enemy. Player moves with WASD key. Make enemies spawn randomly on the edge of the screen.
 Visualise it with Cinder app.

Week 2: Enemies approach the Tank. When player collides with an enemy, life goes down. 
When life is 0, the player dies. Player can shoot bullets with mouse click. 
Link the added features to the Cinder app.

Week 3: Add a bomb that kills all the zombies. Make enemies spawn more frequently and they approach player more fast
as player's survival time increases. Add UI that displays current HP, kill count, and survival time.
